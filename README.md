# FakeCam
A virtual camera app

# some notes

This is no longer under development and might not work. The app in the firstIteration folder should work, but those in the secondIteration probably won't as I didn't include the video directory in that one, and I also never finished that one.

If you want to try the first one, make sure you have v4l2loopback installed and have run `sudo modprobe v4l2loopback`
